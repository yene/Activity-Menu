# Activity Menu
Because iStat Menu stopped working on OS X 10.11 I wrote my own.

# Notes
* the network traffic seems not correct compared to professional tools
* did code it in OBJ-C because C code in swift is something
* setting the view is deprecated in 10.10
* nsstatusitem changes http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24623559/nsstatusitem-change-image-for-dark-tint
